Enables editing of `ForeignKey`, `ManyToMany` and simple text fields using the Autocomplete - `jQuery` plugin.

django-ajax-selects will work in any normal form as well as in the admin.

The user is presented with a text field.  They type a search term or a few letters of a name they are looking for, an ajax request is sent to the server, a search channel returns possible results.  Results are displayed as a drop down menu.  When an item is selected it is added to a display area just below the text field.
